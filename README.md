# Vulnerable AD Assessment
The primary aim of this project is to identify and document the security vulnerabilities commonly associated with misconfigured AD environments; utilising these insights to design an intentionally vulnerable AD domain. A comprehensive vulnerability assessment will then be completed, investigating security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations and general inadequate security controls within the Vulnerable AD Domain.

The assessment will go beyond the scope of a typical vulnerability assessment by demonstrating the exploitation of key findings (vulnerabilities), to highlight the impact of insufficient and/or inadequate security measures and misconfigurations. This study aims to provide insights and recommendations obtained from the Vulnerability Assessment (hereby referred to as “VA”) and exploitation stages, highlighting the critical need for robust and contemporary security measures in AD environments.
